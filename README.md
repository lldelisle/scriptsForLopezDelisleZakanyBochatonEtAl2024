All scripts necessary to build figures from raw data in Lopez-Delisle, Zakany, Bochaton et al. 2024.

The whole pipeline is described into [Run_all.md](./Run_all.md).

`annotations` contains the different files with coordinates of regions used to display on figures. It contains subdirectories with other annotations which were produced from public datasets or from these initial files.

`prepare` contains bash scripts to generate annotations from public datasets and indexes.

Each of these directories contain slurm bash scripts for the corresponding analyses: `ChIPM`, `CUTandRUN`, `nCATS`, `RNAseq`, `scRNAseq (only baredSC slurm scripts)`. `b9b13_evolution` contains the raw data extracted from the ensembl database and the R script used to generate it and the plots. `tail_analysis` contains the raw data, the R script and the plots.

`plots` contains a bash script with all commands to generate configuration files and output files of all figures generated by [pyGenomeTracks](https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks).

A description of all steps to run in which order is available in [this markdown](./Run_all.md).
